DESCRIPTION- Project Title: PERSONAL-PORTFOLIO-WEBPAGE

The goal of this task is to design and develop a basic personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS. This project helps developers showcase their skills, projects, and contact information in a well-structured, responsive, and visually appealing format. A portfolio website is an essential tool for developers to present their work to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It acts as a personal brand and a professional resume on the web.

The deliverable for this task is a single-page responsive website that includes smooth navigation and a clear layout. The page must be mobile-friendly and easy to read across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The use of media queries in CSS ensures that the layout adjusts accordingly to different screen sizes.

The website consists of several key sections:

1. Header & Navigation Bar:
At the top of the page, there is a fixed header containing the site title and a navigation bar. The nav bar includes links to the main sections of the page: "About", "Projects", and "Contact". These links use internal anchors (e.g., #about) to smoothly scroll to the corresponding sections when clicked.

2. About Section:
This section introduces the developer with a short description. It can include personal interests, professional background, skills, or any detail that tells visitors who the developer is. This area sets the tone for the portfolio and gives context to the rest of the content.

3. Projects Section:
The core of the portfolio, this section displays a list of sample projects the developer has worked on. Each project includes a title and a short description. Optionally, it can include links to GitHub repositories or live demos. This section demonstrates technical capability and practical experience.

4. Contact Section:
This final section includes basic contact information, such as email and links to social profiles like GitHub. It enables potential clients or employers to get in touch easily.

5. Footer:
The footer provides a closing note, usually a copyright statement.

From a technical perspective, the webpage is built using clean HTML5 semantic tags like <section>, <header>, and <footer> to improve accessibility and structure. Styling is handled entirely with CSS3, focusing on layout, spacing, typography, colors, and responsiveness. The CSS includes a media query to ensure that the navigation layout adapts well to smaller screens.

No JavaScript or external libraries are used in this basic version, keeping the project simple and beginner-friendly. However, the code structure allows for easy future enhancement, such as adding animations, JavaScript functionality, or integrating frameworks like React.

Overall, this task helps a developer learn the fundamentals of web design, responsive layout creation, and personal branding. It’s a practical and valuable exercise for building confidence in frontend development and showcasing one’s profile online.
